## **Sparked innovation**

Imagine this: You're out for a walk, enjoying the fresh air, and you decide to listen to a blog on a popular website. After all, not everyone enjoys reading all the time. Personally, I'm more of an audio or video learner myself - reading books can feel a bit tedious at times (I'm working on that though, but that's a story for another day!).

So, you're immersed in the audio, eager to absorb knowledge about your favorite topics. But then, something frustrating happens. The AI voice starts stumbling over complex technical terms and confusing abbreviations. It's as if Jake the [TTS (Text-to-Speech)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_to_Speech) service suddenly got tongue-tied. You find yourself pausing the audio, pulling out your phone, and rereading that tricky part just to understand what was said.

Now, here's the twist: That exact scenario happened to me, and it lit up a lightbulb in my mind.

Now, this realization has become my driving force. I can't help but think about those who rely on  [TTS (Text-to-Speech)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_to_Speech) services for web accessibility.

## **Is the web truly accessible ?**

That got me thinking, what people who had difficulty reading faced when surfing the web, We're in an age where web accessibility is often taken for granted. I've seen posts and articles praising how accessible the web has become. Don't get me wrong, it's true that significant improvements have been made, and I've personally witnessed the remarkable evolution of web pages and websites.

However, I couldn't help but wonder, is the web **'truly accessible'** to everybody? This question lingered in my mind as I recalled scenes from movies where blind individuals navigate the internet using TTS services. What struck me was that these TTS services often read text painstakingly slowly, sometimes letter by letter.  I've never thought about why this was happening and it just hit me like a lightning bolt, the current TTS services we have rn suckssssss, to the everyday person maybe not so much, for the people who actually need it the most, clearlyyyyy it does.

## **The webs ~~default language~~ - Times are changing!!!**

For the everyday English dictionary words which it's been trained to be good at pronouncing, it's alright but is that all we read in this new age ? there are slangs, abbreviations, technical terms and myriad of language nuances we encounter on the web. These services, though they've made incredible progress in sounding more 'human' which I think is all they advertise now, a quick google search "text to speech", what shows up is how "realistic our service is", it still falls short in a critical and one of the most important aspects â€“ accurately and confidently handling technical terms, abbreviations, wrong spellings and so much more.

Imagine someone relying on TTS services to learn about the latest technology trends, only to hear jumbled acronyms and botched pronunciations. It's not just frustrating; it's a significant barrier to accessing information and staying informed for the people who rely on them.

## **Exciting journey ahead**

So, here's where my journey begins. I stumbled upon the realization that there's an opportunity to bridge a gap in web accessibility. But how? tbh, I didn't have all the answers. I obviously did some research and a quick google search got me to know what I needed to know to get a solution. But how?  I only know how to develop web applications using trending frameworks and was comfortable with one language - JavaScript. However, that wasn't going to cut it for this challenge.

So I am diving headfirst into the world of learning particularly Python and the intricacies of [NLP (Natural Language Processing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [ML (Machine Learning)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [speech synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis). Over the next three months, I'll be dedicated to learning what is necessary to craft a "simple solution" that bridges this gap in web accessibility. My goal is to ensure that web content is not just 'readable' but 'understandable' for everyone. THREE MONTHS!!!! WOWWW. fr I know, can I do this? yeah I think so,  I just wanted to give myself a time frame so I put in more effort to meet the time frame I set.  

Stay tuned as I delve into this adventure, weaving code and creativity to make web content more accessible and comprehensible. Who knows where this path will lead, but I'm excited to find out. Wish me luck.  Ciao :)
